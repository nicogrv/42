BRAVO AND POISONER.
1206

1269
The Bottomless Lake of our Legend was reputed an outlet of the
1336
Bottomless Pit.  No creature of our world had ever swum its lethal
1400
ebb and flow, but on the nights of the great Sabbaths, when the
1463
wizardry of all Italy swept to its beetling cliffs as to their
1531
Holiest of Holies, its waters eructed to the rendezvous the retinue
1600
of Hell--the wealth of an argosy would not have tempted a Lombard to
1669
venture within eye-shot of it after nightfall.  Who, then, are these
1736
two men of mortal mould that outstare the depths of the Bottomless
1804
Lake itself, and not only that but from the very horns of the Altar
1867
of the Black Mass, and not only that, but at the witching hour
1937
forsooth of night, when graveyards yawn, and the everlasting doors of
2005
Tophet open wide?  Their guardian angels of good have surely turned
2070
from their right hands, and their evil guardians of the left are
2133
grinning from horn to horn.  With the chime of twelve from the
2202
distant steeple dies out the last echo of admonition, and they begin
2271
to work out such unhallowed errand as alone can have brought them to
2340
so damned a spot; the elder of the two in a tone of hushed solemnity
2409
addresses a series of questions to the younger, who responds to them
2473
with an equally awful gravity, after the manner of a catechism.
2474

2499
"Dost know me who I am?"
2500

2539
"Tosca of Venice, bravo and poisoner."
2540

2556
"And Yourself?"
2557

2620
"Janko the Illyrian, bravo with a right good will, but not yet
2631
poisoner."
2632

2647
"My ancestry?"
2648

2713
"Sorcerer stock, whose secrets you would fain have inherited and
2735
their trade pursued."
2736

2753
"Why did I not?"
2754

2817
"The Council of Ten bore down upon your race, and but for your
2884
extreme youth you yourself would have crossed the Bridge of Sighs.
2946
Orphaned by the State, and retaining for sole inheritance the
3014
swashing blade that still gnaws at your scabbard, and a few recipes
3081
for poisons (which last, however, were worth a Borgia's envy), you
3148
soon found yourself compelled to use both the one and the other to
3218
buy you bed and board.  Proceeding at first with hesitancy, and never
3288
sojourning long in one locality, you became by degrees the repository
3352
of so many family secrets that at the present day you may stalk
3418
assured through the length and breadth of Italy, and ruffle it in
3442
what company you will."
3443

3465
"And your own story?"
3466

3534
"I know not by what catastrophe the memory of all my earliest years
3602
was shaken loose from me.  Suffice it then, that once on a visit to
3672
my native country you found me wandering an orphan like yourself, and
3740
with a mind so blank that you appropriated it instantly to write on
3810
it as it were your own ten commandments.  Since that day I have never
3877
left you, and I am only repeating what you yourself tell me when I
3946
say that you have made me your equal master in every trick of fence.
4010
But of that other art of yours that rivals the Creator, my most
4080
dutiful entreaties have never availed with you to teach me anything."
4081

4146
"But did I not reasonably argue that you would better attend the
4213
heaviness of so terrific a responsibility, until you were of man's
4279
estate?  And is not to-day the anniversary of your coming of age?
4348
And have we not pelted hither hot-foot from the confines of the land
4374
upon that very business?"
4375

4442
"It is true that before entrusting me with even the least of these
4508
your ancient awful secrets you have brought me here to-night--for
4515
what?"
4516

4585
"To enter you with fitting state upon the bead-roll of that glorious
4653
mystery, that with the mere putting on of a glove, or sniffing of a
4723
flower can check the most rebellious blood with a thus far shall thou
4746
flow, but no farther!"
4747

4817
"Say, rather to better the assurance that you have of me already from
4879
years of fraternal familiar common life, by laying upon me in
4949
addition a binding bond ensanctified by centuries of warlock use, and
5018
now to be imposed in this very spot where the Master whom thereby we
5088
both shall serve is at this hour present, though to us invisible, the
5121
Prince of the Power of the Air."
5122

5188
"You are at any rate resolved to link yourself to me with fetters
5248
forged in the fire that is not quenched, and by a testament
5316
registered in the Chancery of Hell to the effect that any treachery
5382
from one of us to the other shall be resented and avenged by that
5449
common Master of ours who hears us at this moment from his postern
5483
gate, the Bottomless Lake below?"
5484

5531
"I am resolved to that for which I came here."
5532

5601
"Follow, then, with me the observance of that visible sign and token
5671
that unites us in one blood and in one flesh.  This horn is from that
5741
beast whose form our Master loves to take, when from this altar where
5809
we stand he greets his liegemen and his liege-women turned backward
5878
like his prayers.  This horn I charge to the half with my own blood,
5947
obtained by the biting of my arm.  Now do you likewise bite and fill
6014
and then drink (to my health) the moiety of the draught so mixed."
6015

6051
"May you live till the Last Trump!"
6052

6122
"You have pledged me in it as I now pledge you, and there remains but
6191
one more ceremony.  I am about to throw this emptied receptacle into
6260
the waters of the Bottomless Lake.  You know already that everything
6329
that touches its surface, whether living or dead, is forfeit to that
6398
Ancient of Days that crouches in wait below.  Do you agree that this
6464
will be the fate reserved for that one of us two that shall first
6500
contravene this super-sacred oath?"
6501

6532
"His soul be the devil's fee."
6533

6600
The emptied horn shot like an elf-bolt into the pathless waters of
6666
the Bottomless Lake.  The benighted pair that watched it from the
6731
unhallowed shrine above could have sworn that a hand came up and
6801
caught it as it fell, but a sudden flash of lightning that snapped in
6868
their eyes and a peal of thunder that made the four corners of the
6934
earth to quake rendered that fact uncertain.  The strangers would
7002
then have been only too gladly drenched to the skin that they might
7072
have hugged their wagered souls in the belief that this unweather was
7139
of Nature, and not of the Evil One.  But the Heavens shed no tear.
7206
There succeeded to that single flash and single peal only the same
7273
deadly calm that had preceded them.  Although their business there
7340
was over, neither of the two men cared to suggest to the other his
7404
secret persuasion that there was no need for further stay.  One
7472
o'clock whispered from afar its holy amen to their accursed ritual.
7540
Other hours flitted by, and still they gazed into unplummeted waves
7604
enwrapped in gloom as in their cloaks.  At last as it were by a
7670
simultaneous impulse they turned together, and with a mutual sigh
7738
descended in the direction of the dawning city.  From what has been
7803
said of the superstitious awe with which the Bottomless Lake was
7871
regarded, it will be readily understood that they had to traverse a
7939
considerable distance of uninhabited country before coming in sight
7967
of the main travelled road.
7968

8031
When at last after the painful up and down of many hills, they
8097
perceived the highway cutting through a valley at their feet, the
8165
habitual reserve engendered by their profession moved them to await
8235
atop the passage of a carriage that appeared in sight in the distance
8301
going towards the town rather than continue their journey, and be
8366
passed by it.  As it came nearer both these men who had recently
8435
drunk so deeply of forbidden founts, suddenly uttered an exclamation
8504
that sounded very like a fear.  For they saw at the self-same second
8571
that the coach contained a girl of beauty beyond a sultan's dream,
8640
and that some dozen or so of foot-pads darted from both sides of the
8709
road and seized the heads of her horses.  The report of a pistol was
8777
obviously connected with the fall of the driver like a log from his
8843
box.  The young lady was left with no other defender than a large
8911
black dog that ran behind the carriage, but as the assailants threw
8977
the doors open and hustled her out it became apparent that he was
9047
chained to the vehicle, and in an instant they were beyond his reach.
9115
But at this critical juncture Tosca descended almost, as it seemed,
9183
to the startled abductors with one leap from the heights above, and
9214
with a howl like a wild beast.
9215

9284
Although they did not know it, the finest sword player in Europe was
9352
in their midst.  They went down by couples before him, spitted like
9421
larks.  They had scarcely grasped the miracle of his presence before
9491
the lovely vision of the coach was resting in his left arm (the right
9559
still continuing to deal destruction), and she had scarcely glanced
9628
at his face, when, with a sigh of evident content with her defender,
9696
she hid her golden head in his breast to shut out the shambles from
9763
her eyes.  But the fight was already past.  Half the ravishers lay
9831
stretched upon the ground, and the bravo of Venice needed no second
9895
or even first glance at them to know that they would never rise
9964
again.  The remainder, appalled by a result which they were far from
10033
attributing to the purely human agency which had caused it, had only
10100
to cast a look beneath his black-a-vised brows, when with a shriek
10169
that he was signed in the corner of his eye with the devil's private
10238
mark, they precipitately fled.  The bravo dropped his sword into its
10305
sheath, and now with both arms round her waist he drew the goddess
10368
(as she appeared to him) towards her carriage.  In doing so he
10430
perceived that she had fainted, and printed upon her lips the
10498
fiercest as it was the chastest kiss that he had ever bestowed upon
10568
woman.  By an extraordinary chance (but there was more than chance in
10633
it), after completing the foulest rite, he had stumbled upon the
10700
purest passion of his life.  For no other woman would he have shut
10761
the carriage door as he did now after placing her within it,
10822
remaining himself outside.  And it is needful to add in this
10890
connexion that he had entirely forgotten the very existence of that
10954
comrade just bound to him by a tie indissoluble.  That comrade,
11023
nevertheless, had watched the whole from the altitude where both had
11087
first stood.  Could he have followed the giddy foot-hold of his
11153
patron he would in that moment have slain him in his tracks.  And
11221
that he could in no wise stir from where he stood either previously
11289
to take part in that chance medley, or now to snatch a share in the
11357
reward of it, was due not at all to cowardice (a thing that must of
11427
necessity be unknown to any that followed the fortunes of Tosca), but
11497
to a kind of spell as he fancied that froze him to his place.  And of
11561
this he was indeed well qualified to judge since he had already
11626
experienced the self-same sensation on one (and one only) former
11694
occasion.  What puzzled him was that the obvious cause in the prior
11764
case was a certain amulet of unknown antiquity and power, which Tosca
11834
was accustomed to wear round his neck upon a chain of gold, and which
11897
in a moment of confidence he had shown that once to his pupil.
11960
Whereas on the present occasion the cause of his vertigo could
12025
scarcely be the same, the talisman being invisible.  And yet the
12091
effect was identical.  If anything more than another had been the
12161
actual moving cause of his present icy chill it must certainly be the
12228
damsel of the coach.  So unmistakeable was the hold which the mere
12292
sight of her had taken upon him, that at the instant when Tosca
12361
placed his lips upon hers (and they had never been touched before by
12431
man), the surging up of jealousy burst the shackles of the spell, and
12499
the Illyrian clattered down like an avalanche.  He reached the road
12566
at the important moment when his oblivious partner, after shutting
12631
the door of the coach, was upon the point of mounting the box to
12700
drive the young beauty he knew not whither.  Nor did it occur to him
12762
that he knew not.  But at this precise juncture his dream was
12828
shattered by the advent of the Illyrian flashing fires of jealous
12892
heat from his eyes.  So choked with it was he that he could not
12955
speak, but only pointed with one hand to the carriage while he
13023
clenched the other in Tosca's face.  The Venetian was equally taken
13091
aback by the sudden resurrection of one whose presence in the world
13158
he had totally overlooked.  How long they would have stared at one
13226
another had nothing intervened it would be impossible to say.  They
13288
were heedless of the barking of the black dog, since that had
13351
continued without intermission from the first irruption of the
13418
bid-stands.  But they were twitched bolt round in the direction of
13487
the coach by a sudden crack of its wheels.  Whether the coachman had
13553
fallen from his box through a genuine belief that he was hurt; or
13618
whether through an equally genuine desire not to be; or, lastly,
13684
through collusion did not appear, but it was sufficiently obvious
13754
that the fellow had not received a scratch.  Concluding the danger to
13822
be over he had now quietly reassumed his post, and was driving off.
13891
He took no more notice of the other two than if he had not seen them
13959
(which again might really have been the case), and used his whip to
14029
such good purpose that the vehicle was lost to sight (to memory dear)
14094
before the rivals had taken a step to arrest its progress.  Then
14155
burst the storm of mutual recrimination.  Tosca first spoke.
14156

14224
"Darkness and devils!  You have robbed me of that for which I would
14268
not leave whole the skin of any man alive."
14269

14338
"'S death, kinsman, would you draw on me?  Remember you not the oath
14404
of some few hours ago?  Are you already so anxious to tap at that
14474
postern we both wot of?  Knock then, and it shall be opened unto you.
14543
Ho, you pale at this reminder, and suffer your hand to drop from the
14582
hilt of that ancestral spit of yours."
14583

14648
"You were well advised to speak before I had drawn, or you would
14716
perchance have learned ere this that there are one or two tricks of
14751
fence I never taught even to you."
14752

14818
"Deceit upon deceit.  You have always given me to understand that
14886
there was absolutely nothing in that branch of our partnership that
14952
you had not revealed to me.  Perchance I shall ere long come upon
15022
some other tit-bit churlishly rapt aside.  But why do I chide you for
15089
teaching me too little, when I had rather cause to weep salt tears
15157
that you have fathered me too much?  When you met me, I had, as you
15223
have told me oft, a mind so blank that you could write on it (and
15290
that was the attraction that led you to adopt me) whatever kind of
15359
script you chose; And you chose to scribble the Devil's A, B, C.  It
15423
is through your corruption of my innocent youth that I am unfit
15489
to-day to even look upon such as she who has just escaped us (and
15559
there ruled her favouring star).  And if you reply that you have kept
15619
me till I was of age, unspotted from the worst half of your
15689
villainies, I dare swear that I should not be far out in conjecturing
15757
that regard for the safety of your body, rather than for that of my
15826
soul, was the true reason why you have never yet suffered me to wear
15894
the glass mask in your laboratories.  And, to crown all, you kissed
15900
her."
15901

15946
"Did I kiss her?  I thought it was a dream."
15947

16012
Thus Tosca murmured softly to himself, his head falling upon his
16079
breast, as if in communion with some saint.  It was Janko who this
16147
time broke the silence by clutching of his sword.  But Tosca looked
16217
up with a glance so diabolical, that he dropped it again at once.  By
16286
a motion of his hand, the Venetian, as it were compelled him to seat
16352
himself by the side of the road; and, sitting quietly beside him,
16389
commenced in the following strain:--
16390

16452
"You make me laugh apart when you speak of my corrupting your
16519
innocent youth.  If you only knew the truth!  Or, as you said just
16588
now (God knows whether inspired by good or evil chance), if you only
16655
knew that tit-bit rapt aside, as you thought, churlishly (when you
16724
merely guessed at it), but in reality with more generosity, than you
16794
will be decently able to thank me for (when you only know the facts).
16859
Your innocent youth, indeed!!  By the God above us, whom we both
16925
fear, and neither serves, you will see by the story I am about to
16993
tell you that I knew all the time and as I say with generosity have
17060
concealed from you the nature of that catastrophe that shook loose
17129
from you the memories of all your earliest years.  You will see that
17197
before your mind became a blank, I had read upon it (tender as were
17264
your years) the lurid brand of Cain.  You will see that your brain
17331
was seared by your own atrocious hand, and that my adoption of you
17401
afterwards was based on the calculation that for a bravo and poisoner
17471
there could be in the whole round world no better raw material than a
17540
matricide!  Start not till you have heard me out.  I was in Illyria.
17610
Reasons which your experience of ups and downs in our profession will
17675
readily enable you to appreciate had caused me to retire (rather
17740
hurriedly, I confess) from the town which I had honoured with my
17807
presence for some months.  The same reasons oblige me to travel in
17872
preference by night, and to secrete myself by day.  On the first
17935
occasion of my doing this latter, I settled upon an apparently
17997
deserted hut in the trackless depths of the forest.  This hut
18065
consisted of a large front room (reaching to the roof tree) for the
18134
accommodation of the two-footed, and a stall at back for that of the
18201
four-footed creation.  The latter did not run so high as the front
18270
room, Inasmuch as it contained a loft for fodder atop, and it was in
18337
this airy apartment that I decided to take my siesta, since it had
18404
openings both upon the stables (if I may so call it) and the front
18474
chamber, and my disposition as you know is strategic.  I had slept, I
18538
know not how long, when I was awakened by a noise in front, and
18605
speedily ascertained that it was caused by an altercation going on
18673
among visitors to the parlour.  Do not start till you have heard me
18740
out.  One of the disputants was yourself.  The other, who occupied
18809
the only stool in the place, was a grey-haired, blear-eyed female of
18875
considerable antiquity.  I know nothing of your accursed Illyrian
18943
jargon.  But without understanding the conversation I could see the
19011
beldame hugging to her withered breast a jewel, small, but of great
19076
price, and withal slung upon a golden chain.  I tell you without
19146
hesitation that it was the same amulet you have been shown by me upon
19214
a previous occasion, foolishly as it happened, since it stirred you
19283
so profoundly as to almost resurrect your buried remembrances.  That
19352
it came into the hands of your precious dame by some feat of robbery
19420
I have no doubt whatever.  How it came into mine you will presently
19489
see.  Your excited gesture, as it seemed to me, might afford me some
19557
clue to the progress of the quarrel, which I presumed had arisen as
19615
to the fate of your booty, but I had scarcely awakened up
19684
sufficiently to pull my reasoning faculties together, when the whole
19750
thing ended in an, even to me, unexpectedly horrible manner.  You
19819
suddenly pushed a pail (which stood hard by) beneath the back of the
19886
unsuspecting crone, and flashing a hanger from under your rags you
19951
swept off her grey head into the bucket with the single shearing
20018
stroke of a seasoned cut-throat.  Then throwing upon the floor the
20082
glittering bauble of contention, you surprised me still more by
20149
swiftly separating the hands and feet, then the arms at elbow, and
20215
the legs at knee, then the stumps from the trunk, and finally the
20284
trunk itself into smaller parcels.  That moment, and to-day, are the
20354
two occasions of my life upon which I have loathed my calling.  By my
20421
word and oath I was as sick as a dog upon the litter of your loft.
20487
When I looked again you had cast down the weeping steel which had
20549
been the unwilling instrument of your crime.  Packing all the
20617
sections in a kind of bag or sack you rolled it up compactly.  Then
20683
seizing the ensanguined pail in the hand that was not occupied by
20750
that pitiful truss of what had just been humanity, you strode with
20815
them both from the desecrated home, but how you disposed of your
20885
burdens I neither know nor care.  That you had loaded your conscience
20952
with a grislier deed than it could bear, I soon had good reason to
21022
know.  Perturbed at my perturbation I had scrambled to _terra firma_,
21087
and had recovered myself sufficiently only to secure that amulet
21157
(which as you know I still wear), when you re-entered empty handed in
21227
that same state of idiocy, which moved me to overcome my distaste for
21293
associates and adjoin you to myself in my profession.  Besides, I
21362
could not but admit (when once more fully myself) that you had shown
21393
for it considerable vocation."
21394

21462
The face of the Illyrian rolled with beads of sweat.  For the third
21525
time he was bound hard and fast by that same fascination which
21594
already twice before had enthralled him.  And as each time before so
21660
again it was for a different cause.  The first of these two prior
21730
occasions resulted, as we know, from the sighting of the amulet.  The
21799
second on the sighting of the divinity of the coach.  But this third
21866
time was again different from the other two, in this respect, that
21935
(although he would not have confessed it for all the riches entombed
22005
in earth) he had now fully recognised the reason and connexion of all
22047
three.  He rose deliberately and spoke:--
22048

22116
"Now, you have told me, to suit your own purposes, a certain amount
22175
of the truth, I remember to your confusion the details you
22245
intentionally omitted.  You lie in your throat when you say that when
22306
I re-entered that room I was in the vacant state already.  I
22375
re-entered that room (and you know it) as sane as when I left it.  I
22441
found you standing there prepared with a glib story to the effect
22509
that you were a stranger just stepped into the hut with the view of
22578
seeing whether it was inhabited or not by anyone who could serve you
22647
as a guide through the forest.  Not knowing you so well as I do now,
22714
I was simple enough to believe you.  It never entered my head that
22784
you could have witnessed the drama that had just been played, nor did
22851
I think of the talisman in my momentary confusion at seeing in the
22920
place a foreigner.  I have now no doubt but that if I had looked for
22990
it I should not have been able to find it.  You diverted my attention
23056
by inviting me to quaff from your spirit flask on the plea that I
23120
looked unwell, as in truth I might, after the ordeal I had just
23189
passed through.  In my innocence (for I was innocent) I accepted the
23257
draught, and the drug which you had placed in the liquor beforehand
23327
destroyed my memory, never to return, until this eventful day.  Yet I
23396
think there was, however, one former occasion which it just missed a
23464
return.  That was when you showed me that ill-omened amulet, and it
23530
awakened in me sentiment inexplicable then, but which now I am no
23593
longer at a loss to understand.  That jewel was wrought by the
23658
science of my kinswoman, in whose hands you surprised it--for my
23720
people, too, were of the ancient religion, like your own, and
23750
sorcerers of the Black Side."
23751

23812
At the commencement of this speech, Tosca seemed momentarily
23880
disconcerted, but, as it continued, this sentiment was succeeded by
23945
something very like prostration, and when he replied it was with
23956
reverence.
23957

24026
"What a galliard this is, and how aright I guessed when I saw in him
24093
the making of a master in my trade.  I thought to dash him with my
24161
revelation of a monstrosity among crimes.  I was a fool, indeed, to
24228
think that a younker would bleach over the dissection of a granny,
24295
who had anointed him from his cradle with the grease of unbaptised
24362
babes.  But I failed, and there's an end on't, and now sheer steel
24431
must decide the issue, for we meet on equal ground.  Equal do I say?
24501
Nay! the boy is my superior in callousness, for I dearly loved my own
24555
old people, though I never say God rest their souls."
24556

24626
He rose, and both men laid their hands upon their hilts.  One of them
24691
had not very long to live.  But before entering upon the fateful
24734
lists, the Illyrian turned to speak again.
24735

24803
"In case you slay me, which I believe will not be the case (for God
24872
does sometimes defend the right), I cannot forbear an answer to your
24940
last taunt.  You did not understand, and you have never understood,
25008
and you never will understand the real meaning of the scene you saw
25076
enacted in that room upon that day.  I am not sure whether it was a
25146
blessing or a curse upon our race that you did not catch the drift of
25212
our remarks in our native language, which you contemptuously term
25281
jargon.  Had you done so the fate of all three of us would have been
25350
better or worse, but at any rate far different.  The tortures of the
25420
Inquisition would not force from me the secret, which was confided to
25487
me then by that ancient lady whom you saw me slay indeed, but only
25556
after her own repeated prayers and instructions.  I shudder to think
25625
what has become of her remains which she entrusted to my pious care,
25690
and which for your accursed interference I have been unwillingly
25758
prevented from attending to.  I know, indeed, the fate of her other
25828
legacy (for the amulet was a legacy that you thought a theft); but it
25897
is now too late (again through your accursed interference) for me to
25964
make such use of that knowledge as she had enjoined upon me to do.
26033
But to you (who know nothing of its use and profit) it shall hang as
26102
a millstone round your neck, and whether you live or whether you die
26168
it shall infallibly sink you now or hereafter to the undiscovered
26234
bottom of that Bottomless Lake whose source we both do know.  And
26300
whichever of us falls shall by the terms of that enactment (of so
26367
short a while ago) be resented and avenged by that Master of ours,
26425
who waits even at this moment for that most unhappy man."
26426

26483
The face of Tosca became white and red.  He flashed that
26551
time-honoured blade of his from its sheath, and motioned with it to
26617
the Illyrian to take up a position opposite to him.  Janko turned
26684
round for one second to do so, and in that second the sword of his
26753
faithless foe was plunged remorselessly through his back.  The point
26820
protruded through his breast.  The next instant the sword had been
26889
withdrawn, and the Illyrian lay upon the turf among the ragged hedge
26956
pirates, who had fallen before by the same trained hand.  But this
27025
time the Venetian took the trouble to assure himself of the death of
27091
his foe before returning his sword to its bed.  That was the only
27159
honour he paid to the body that had once been only less dear to him
27229
than his own.  That done, he threw himself down at the road side, and
27297
took out from under his doublet that very talisman of which we have
27360
heard so much.  It had gained greatly in his estimation by the
27422
mystery which had lately thickened round it.  We have already
27490
mentioned that it was suspended round his neck by a gold chain; but
27560
we must now give a more particular description of the gem itself.  It
27626
had undoubtedly originally been intended for a seal, or, to speak
27692
more correctly, seven seals, for it had (and this constituted its
27762
particularity) seven sides or facets, and on each of these engraved a
27831
sigil or cabalistic monogram, and each sigil was that of a different
27899
planet of the seven that rule over the seven days of the week.  All
27968
this the bravo, from his early environment, was sufficiently skilled
28036
to know.  He also recognised at once that the person wishing to use
28104
the stone for its original purpose of sealing, would choose on each
28174
day that facet of the gem which bore the signature of the planet that
28239
presided over the day in question.  But this, though no doubt of
28307
considerable efficiency, was not by any means of so great virtue as
28372
to sufficiently explain the very enigmatical manner in which the
28441
amulet had been alluded to by the hapless boy, whose present fate he
28510
shuddered to reflect on.  He endeavoured, with more or less success,
28578
to banish speculation on that point by returning to his examination
28642
of the ring, if we may apply that term to a jewel which was not
28711
pierced with sufficiently large a hole to fit even upon the smallest
28777
of fingers.  Such hole as it had, and through which its chain now
28846
passed, he conjectured must have been originally intended to receive
28915
the handle of the seal, upon which, fitting loosely, the gem turning
28981
round and round could be made to present any facet desired to the
29046
paper which its owner intended to impress.  At this point of his
29116
meditation the bravo was aroused by the sound of footsteps.  A number
29180
of officials, both on horse and otherwise, had arrived from the
29249
neighbouring town.  These he recognised at once as belonging to that
29319
inconvenient class (the guardians, let us say, of public safety) from
29389
whom he had fled on many another well remembered occasion besides the
29453
one he had just made mention of in his story to the ill-starred
29523
Illyrian.  Yet at the present moment he had no fear of them.  Perhaps
29593
this was because he knew that they came on account of the depositions
29663
of the lodestar of his dreams, and that he would have run any risk to
29733
be brought once more into chain with her.  A less hardened adventurer
29802
might have been embarrassed by the presence of Janko's body.  But to
29863
a fertility of resource such as Tosca had needs acquired, it
29931
presented no obstacle whatever.  He rose, and bowed with a grace he
29999
had learned in the very highest society.  The officers returned his
30069
salute.  They conjectured rightly that this stranger of distinguished
30136
appearance was the beaten blade who had performed the prodigies of
30199
valour, which when told them in the city they had deemed to be
30265
fabulous, but of which they now saw the proofs before their eyes.
30331
The obliging champion was quite willing to relate his own private
30399
version of the affair.  He paused only to consider whether it would
30466
be advisable to have been wounded slightly, but he decided against
30509
this fiction as liable to lead to trouble.
30510

30572
"Yes; as you say, I naturally wished to rest awhile after the
30638
fatigues of such a combat.  Besides, I guessed, of course, that I
30705
should soon see upon the field of battle you gentlemen of justice,
30771
whose promptness in these matters has become proverbial, and with
30840
whom I would not for the world have lost the chance of an interview.
30907
I might, it is true, have foisted myself into the carriage for its
30970
journey to town.  But the lady, as she doubtless told you, had
31039
fainted right away, and I was therefore debarred from obtaining that
31106
permission, without which no man of breeding could venture to take
31175
such a liberty.  And before I had time to achieve a seat on the box,
31243
the coachman was off; for the fellow was drunk, as your penetration
31311
must have perceived from the muddled state of his evidence.  Of the
31380
valour you so kindly allude to, my modesty forbids me to speak.  But
31442
I am bound in honour to temper your flattering opinion of the
31510
achievement by confessing that I am a fencing master by profession,
31578
and that a score or so of thrusts and parries is merely a matter of
31648
daily bread with me.  I must add, in this connexion, that I am also a
31712
physician, and one possessed of medicaments that cure all ills.
31781
Further, I was proceeding to your town with the view of establishing
31848
a dual practice among you, when this trifle we are discussing fell
31912
athwart the even tenor of my way, and I hope still to establish
31981
myself there, and even to continue my journey in your company (which
32044
is such as I most affect) now this accident has given me, as I
32111
perceive, introduction to all the most desirable connexions in the
32174
place.  You will notice yonder, by the way, a fellow of better
32244
apparal than the rest of the run-a-gates, and whom I take to be their
32312
captain.  The other scaramouches gave me no trouble whatever, but I
32381
must confess that the spadassin in question was a little bit more of
32449
a customer.  I had the lady on one arm (as she doubtless told you),
32517
and had the rabble been able to get on all sides of me at once, the
32586
affair would indeed have been the devil's delight.  But since I kept
32651
my back, like an old campaigner, to the coach, I felt no kind of
32721
flurry; and, as I knew from the first that I should, I came at length
32786
to disarm him.  The poltroon then turned to save his skin (I had
32852
thought him braver stuff); but I, as you may suppose, was far too
32920
limber for him, and skewered him through the back.  You can see for
32988
yourselves how my point protruded through his breast.  In my humble
33058
opinion he might well dance in chains here on a gibbet upon the scene
33128
of his crime, as a warning to the rest of his riff-raff that scuttled
33187
away from my invincible arm as soon as their leader fell."
33188

33254
This Tosca considered the master-stroke of his dissimulation.  No
33322
suspicion could now light upon him.  The lady had seen but him, and
33391
knew nothing of his companion.  The coachman had either seen two men
33449
or none.  If he spoke of two they would ascribe it to his
33516
drunkenness, and inquire if he did not also see two ladies.  Tosca
33584
was furthest of all from suspecting that by this very suggestion he
33654
thought to be so masterly he was forging the bolt that should destroy
33724
him.  With delight he perceived that the officers had clutched at his
33793
idea, and immediately set their underlings to work upon the gallows,
33863
after first entombing the raggeder ruffians ignominiously in a ditch.
33925
Leaving them to their congenial work Tosca proceeded with the
33995
officers to town, and gathered as he went all the particulars that he
34065
could of his enchantress.  And her name, which he heard for the first
34134
time, seemed familiar as a household word.  Vergilia had resided for
34204
months in the city, but was by birth a stranger, from what country no
34268
one knew.  It was only known that she had sojourned for similar
34331
periods in other principal places.  She was an orphan, she was
34395
unmarried, she was an heiress.  Wherever she pleased to set her
34461
wandering feet men flocked in shoals to be trampled beneath them.
34524
And of these, Tosca shrewdly guessed, were the majority of his
34591
present companions.  She consistently refused all offers, and this
34661
was the unanswerable argument of the more logical sex to their women,
34731
who hated her like poison, and who would have it that she made use of
34799
love philtres to effect her endless conquests.  The only ground for
34863
this assertion seemed to be that wherever she travelled her bed
34933
chamber was always sacredly reserved to her own person, entered by no
35000
one else under any circumstances whatever, and locked when she was
35070
not within, she herself performing all domestic duties connected with
35137
it.  Those admirers of hers, who had not yet put their fate to the
35204
touch, all indignantly scouted the theory advanced by the rejected
35270
that she concealed a lover in this sanctum.  Nor was such an idea
35340
surely possible to any one who looked with unjaundiced eye, even once
35409
on her virginal purity.  Tosca gazed on her for the second time that
35471
day, and swore within his heart of hearts (quite drowning all
35541
recollection of that prior oath) that the very first lover she should
35580
have would be none other than himself.

PART II.
35615

35635
THE DEVIL'S CANDLE.
35636

35704
The revolution of our legend brings us once more round to that same
35772
direful boundary hour, with which it was commenced between midnight
35842
and the first born of the day.  But on the hills a gibbet stands that
35909
stood not there before, a beacon to the minions of the moon.  Alas
35975
for the misguided youth that hangs there helpless and unhouseled.
36040
His brave attire the cupidity of his topsmen had appropriated to
36109
their own use.  His body they had arrayed for the sake of decency in
36177
rags stripped from the verminiferous trunks of his several supposed
36237
followers, and these huddled him like the swathings of some
36301
dismantled mummy.  A gorged carrion bird dozes upon each of his
36371
shoulders.  The hinds, whom their business brought upon the road even
36438
so late as twilight, had run afield copiously crossing themselves.
36508
Who, then, is this--a woman, too--that comes at the awfullest hour of
36576
all, and to the very foot of the gallows?  Nothing but her eyes can
36642
be seen from under her hood.  Are those the eyes of Vergilia that
36712
Tosca dreams of and deems unfathomable as the Bottomless Lake itself?
36778
Is the intuition of her sex, then, unfailing after all, and she a
36845
witch, that with love philtres works her syren spell, and seeks at
36912
this dread hour for the wherewithal?  And what, then, can she peer
36977
for about the foundations of a gibbet, save alone that fetid and
37047
fearsome white-flowered orange-berried Devil's Candle mandragora that
37109
is engendered in the womb of earth from a gibbeted murderer's
37178
drippings on the midnight of his death?  The Illyrian bravo had been
37247
seven times a murderer (if not seventy times seven), and many a lost
37316
soul rejoiced in Hell that night over the weird that the witch woman
37384
was to work.  She has found it at last, the favourable specimen, by
37452
her long sought through fruitless years.  She has found the root in
37510
human form complete--two armed, two legged--the Microcosm
37576
caricaturing man.  And now her low whistle brings her black hound
37644
forward out of the black night.  Even she is affected as she kisses
37709
him for the last time.  Iscariotical kiss!  With a cord from her
37779
youthful waist she attaches animal and plant together, and flees from
37848
thence, stopping her ears as she runs.  The hound (whose faith is to
37916
strike his death-knell) seeks to follow her, and finds himself held
37984
back.  He wrestles with the invisible obstacle and conquers, but to
38049
die, for as the unholy mannikin root is perforce torn out of its
38119
mother earth it utters a piercing shriek that makes rattle the chains
38184
of its father above, and the hound, in an instant foaming at the
38250
mouth, in fits expires.  Then, and then only, turns the murderess
38317
back on her blood-stained steps.  The carcase of her sole unvenial
38387
follower she casts falteringly apart,  The girdle is already attached
38456
by one end to the gruesome plant.  By throwing round to it the other
38526
end she completes the circuit of her shapely throat, and held fast by
38594
this improvised necklace tucks the loathsome herb creature into her
38661
lovely bosom, which no being of its sex had ever yet been free of.
38731
Hence now to develop him, for to this is that secret chamber destined
38793
that had never seen denizen but herself before.  There is her
38860
laboratory, and there shall this earth child be magically tendered
38925
and nourished, and most magically grow to more and more of man's
38995
resemblance.  Since in a manner by his mystical birth he is one flesh
39063
and blood with the murderer that begot him, he is perforce of Hell,
39130
and can Hell's secrets impart to the enchantress that holds him in
39195
her power.  To what her cravings tend, which by his means or any
39265
other that affords itself, she must and will by hook or crook attain,
39332
we now shall shortly see.  In spite of her evident youth, Vergilia
39401
was far too accomplished an actress, of course, to reveal by word or
39469
sign her secret studies to the gilded youth that continue to throng
39539
her halls.  But Tosca visited her upon a different footing.  Spending
39601
his days with her in the body, and his nights with her in the
39667
spirit--spacing out with drink and dice the unutterable intervals
39728
when he could do neither one nor the other--he neglected his
39796
professional avocations altogether, and existed absolutely for her.
39862
On her part she had shown him, as we have seen, particular favour
39931
from the first moment she saw him, and this became continuously more
40001
and more after she had wormed his story from him--as much as he chose
40069
to tell, and which of course excluded entirely the existence of the
40134
Illyrian--until at length she requited him with like confidence.
40202
What the butterflies that sought their own purposes about her chose
40270
to think of her preference she cared not, but her modesty at length
40340
obliged her to account for it in private to the preferred one himself
40408
by alleging the similarity of their descent (for that she also came
40477
of old necromantic stock), and to explain her refusal of all suitors
40544
(even to coronets) on the grounds that none of them could satisfy,
40614
till Tosca came, her yearnings for the occult.  To an archimage alone
40681
would she give her right hand, and his right hand she meant to be.
40751
The blessing of the Church would be a curse to such a pair.  Heedless
40821
then of what, in their position, they needs must deem the degradation
40889
of any such ceremony, she had herself devised her own test piece by
40957
which a favoured suitor could be at the same time tried, and by its
41025
failure or success dismissed or indissolubly wedded.  She had sworn
41089
in fact to bestow herself without reserve upon the student (his
41159
person being also to her fancy) who could call up for her substantial
41219
from the vasty deep a magical palace in which her fantastic
41279
imagination had long run riot, and in which carnal love and
41347
cabalistic lore should wander hand in hand the livelong day without
41411
let or hindrance from the outer world well lost.  Prone to such
41480
thoughts from her cradle, this aerial architecture of hers had taken
41542
final shape in the first days of her visit to that town, when
41611
disdaining the legend of the boors, she had penetrated the precincts
41680
of the Bottomless Lake, and quickened her brain with the idea of how
41741
suitable to a lover and his mistress would be retreat into a
41806
never-visited seclusion such as that.  Then the thing grew.  She
41876
pictured and demolished one after another various enchanted buildings
41944
floating upon the waters themselves (and that was the common thread
42013
that ran through them all) sailing to the shore upon the wish of the
42083
dwellers in them, but entirely inaccessible to any outward authority,
42152
either human or divine.  Now that she had discovered the Venetian to
42221
be the one man to whom she would accord permission to substantialise
42289
her dreams (supposing he could find the power) she submitted to him
42357
with much shy laughter her latest ground plan of this castle in the
42427
air.  She had borrowed from the sensuous East its key-hole arches and
42494
quadrangular bowers built round, and enclosing court yards glowing
42561
with flowers from every region of the earth, and never the same at
42627
two successive visits.  Birds interchanged at every inspection in
42696
like manner were to agitate the air with their antiphonies.  And the
42765
fountains in the centres of all the court yards (fed from the waters
42832
of the Bottomless Lake) when lapped into the beakers of the lovers
42898
would become the rarest wine.  The outermost waters would glister
42966
with gold and silver fish, shot through with the plungings of white
43031
aquatic birds.  Within the building, the rooms kaleidoscopically
43096
should never meet them twice with the same face.  Their servants
43163
should be automata scattered through every chamber, and ready at a
43232
touch to fly to master or mistress like genii of the Arabian Nights,
43293
but instantly relapsing after service into their first stony
43358
insensibility.  Of much more Vergilia whispered such as at times
43427
frenzied in Tosca the knowledge of his impotence to win her upon her
43496
terms.  Had he but inherited the secrets of his fathers!  Had he but
43566
the knowledge stored up in the grey brain of that hairless blear-eyed
43636
Hell-sent hag of Illyria!  Could he but solve the enigma of the Seven
43705
Sigils, that at any rate might bring him somewhat nearer to his end!
43775
And his rivals envied him.  Closer and closer there seemed to flutter
43844
to him the moth they thought he had singed.  But never close enough.
43913
Then came an event that led up to his climax of fruition found green
43981
in the mouth.  Stated in short, it fell somewhat as follows: At the
44048
end of her daily banquet she was wont to leave her guests to their
44111
wine, while she paid one of her frequent visits to that unseen
44179
chamber.  One of those disappointed suitors of hers (as it chanced,
44249
or was fated on a certain day), inspired with the valour of much wine
44315
imbibed after she had left her table, swore roundly that he would
44382
follow her, and pluck out at any hazard the heart of that mystery.
44452
Before he could be stopped by fellow guest or flunkey he had stumbled
44519
up the stairway, and burst open the door she had but lately closed
44582
behind her.  The next moment a most frightful shriek resounded
44649
through every corner of the house.  It was not Vergilia's.  It was
44717
uttered by the fool-hardy intruder.  The company started from their
44786
seats.  But before they could do anything he staggered into the room
44856
again with hair as white as snow, and lips that gibbered loathsomely.
44922
Amid a scene of indescribable confusion he was carried off by his
44989
friends insane and inpenetrable as to the cause of his fright, nor
45058
did he ever recover sufficiently to give an explanation of it.  When
45122
all the rest of the terrified crowd of loungers and lackeys had
45191
hustled pell mell from the house, Tosca alone remained.  His hour he
45260
thought had come.  But it was only in a measure so.  The lady of the
45327
house re-appeared, it is true, after the hurried exodus of masters
45389
and servants, and agitated as he had expected, but not to his
45458
surprise by their defection.  She babbled brokenly, instead, of some
45526
one else whom she had lost through the unexpected intrusion of that
45595
venturesome drunkard, now sobered for good and all.  Thus she rooted
45665
from that moment in the mind of Tosca the horrible suspicion that the
45733
story of the concealed lover might have some truth in it after all.
45802
How could he know aught of her experimental mandrake culture, for of
45865
course it was the mandrake she referred to?  The only creature
45934
besides herself that had witnessed her infernal arcana had just been
46003
borne a mouthing maniac from the seat of her operations, and perhaps
46072
not even had time enough to notice the nature of the disaster, which
46140
his untimely interference had brought about.  However, for the time
46203
Tosca dismissed his suspicions when she fell into his arms and
46272
telling him between laughter and tears that he was now the only hope
46340
that remained to her, she begged him at once to summon together all
46409
his scattered occult acquirements, and make an incantation that very
46478
night that should yield them both their heart's desire.  He swore to
46546
do so, hardly knowing what he swore, and fled from her in a wind of
46615
excited passion and passionate resolve.  For some time after this he
46682
endeavoured to put his ideas coherently together by dint of pacing
46747
madly through the streets.  It was already dusk, and at first he
46817
elicited no remark.  But presently he noticed that his footsteps were
46886
being dogged.  He was a connoisseur in such matters.  This must be a
46953
rival more fixed than the remainder of the craven herd that had so
47021
readily taken flight, and one that had watched the bravo during the
47087
time that he stayed behind.  Or perchance nothing more mysterious
47157
than a dunning creditor, for Tosca had lately run out of ready money,
47227
and while exercising no trade still maintained a splendid appearance.
47293
Nor had this also been altogether without weight with him when he
47360
accepted the challenge of his bewitching mistress.  Not wishing to
47430
embroil himself with the person whom he supposed to be shadowing him,
47495
he entered a tavern and called for wine.  He had scarcely seated
47564
himself when a masked stranger of short stature and somewhat uncouth
47629
appearance entered the same inn, and sat down at the same table,
47697
giving the same order.  The nerves of our Venetian were more shaken
47765
by the extraordinary episode of the afternoon than he would himself
47827
have cared to own.  Not liking the looks of his would-be boon
47894
companion, and conjecturing some connexion between that individual
47957
and the counter of his paces, Tosca got up and left the tavern
48026
without awaiting the execution of his command.  To his consternation
48091
the stranger followed him.  An exciting chase ensued.  The bravo
48159
entered house after house, seating himself in each case, and always
48227
closely hugged by his mysterious hanger on, who as regularly seated
48296
himself by the bravo's side, and as soon as he withdrew followed him
48365
out into the street.  A kind of panic seized the fearless swordsman.
48435
A challenge to the inexplicable stranger stuck again and again in his
48499
throat.  At last the houses began to close their shutters.  The
48565
baffled fugitive struck desperately out of the town into the open
48632
country, and made his way in the direction of the Bottomless Lake.
48702
As the footfalls of his ghostly visitant pattered still behind him he
48766
consoled himself with the grim reflection that right up to that
48832
ill-omened shore, at any rate, the spy would not dare to venture.
48899
But he was mistaken.  As he paused breathless on the brink of that
48961
Stygian sea and faced round boldly on to what he deemed to be
49031
invisibility, he found it was instead the form of his fear that stood
49101
there as before.  He was seized with the boldness of desperation, and
49165
addressed the mysterious and still masked being with a voice of
49181
tolerable calm.
49182

49226
"Who are you, and what is your need of me?"
49227

49297
"I am Magloire, a necromancer of France, and it is you that have need
49305
of me."
49306

49337
"You are over bold to say so."
49338

49406
"I say what I know.  Dare you deny that you entertain the intention
49476
of making an incantation here this very night, and that you lack only
49542
the means to do so?  A scheme of geomancy acquainted me with your
49610
design, and being entangled in your fate, for reasons that you must
49677
not know (for you will know them if anything too soon) I sped from
49739
afar upon wings of wind to conduct your conjuration for you."
49740

49769
"You have a price for this?"
49770

49835
"I see you are a man of the world, and are aware that nothing is
49900
usually given for nothing.  I ask you merely to sign this bond."
49901

49970
"I understand your interest in me better than you seem to think, and
50022
on no account will I barter away my immortal soul."
50023

50091
"Your immortal soul, do you say?  By the Nine Legions of Hell, does
50158
the man think that the cross was stretched on Calvary for any such
50221
scum as he?  Your immortal soul, of which you hug yourself the
50290
possessor, was lost irredeemably from your cradle up.  The signature
50324
to the bond is a matter of form."
50325

50390
"You do not think so since you ask me to sign it.  But ask of me
50436
anything else, and it shall be given to you."
50437

50507
"By the tie of which I spoke, that is stronger than blood as blood is
50569
thicker than water (so they say), I will help you, though you
50637
vouchsafe me a mere keepsake.  Make over to me that amulet that you
50704
wear around your neck, and the bargain is firm and true.  The dawn
50770
shall caress a tenement based on the shifting foundation of these
50832
waters, such as even shall satisfy the caprices of Vergilia."
50833

50903
The bravo had recovered himself, as we have said, but these evidences
50965
of an intimate knowledge of his affairs filled him again with
51030
apprehension.  And the stranger still continued masked.  After a
51092
short deliberation, however, Tosca decided not to let slip an
51156
opportunity as welcome as unexpected, and granted apparently in
51226
exchange for a trinket of no worth to him whatever, though he was not
51296
unaware that it might be of inestimable value to any one who knew (as
51365
this Frenchman presumably did) the secret of the Seven Sigils.  With
51435
a parting sigh for its enigma still unsolved, so often the toy of his
51504
leisure hours, he detached it from his neck, and passed it on to the
51570
Gaul, who fastened it about his own.  That he was a wizard of his
51635
word became immediately apparent.  Taking up a piece of chalk he
51700
scored out rapidly a double circle, one circumference within the
51770
other, upon the shelf of rock upon which they stood.  Between the two
51838
circumferences he drew a ring of symbols of purport to the Venetian
51900
unknown, but which he endeavoured to retain in his memory for
51965
possible future use.  Within the innermost of these two lines of
52031
defence the sorcerer collected a quantity of brushwood, and after
52097
having ignited these materials he entrusted the bravo with sundry
52165
perfumes, some in the shape of evil smelling dried stuffs, and some
52231
sealed up in phials, with minute instructions as to the order and
52299
quantities in which (the incantation having commenced) they were to
52363
feed the fire.  To Magloire would fall the duty of reciting the
52429
continuous charge which for the whole duration of the work was to
52488
hold the evil angels in thrall.  Lastly, the Gaul drew his
52555
companion's attention to the fact that as soon as midnight sounded
52623
the conjuration was to commence, and before one must end.  For that
52693
hour alone would signatory protectors avail him against the furies he
52760
evoked.  But this Tosca already knew.  He was, as we have seen, no
52826
such novice in the worship of powers retrograde as this schooling
52894
showed his colleague to believe.  The distant clock now struck (how
52964
well the bravo remembered all the circumstances in which he had heard
53027
that sound from this spot before), and the sorcerer began in a
53091
thunderous voice to recite his litanies.  Couched throughout in
53155
somewhat dubious Latinity they were by the bravo only partially
53222
understood, but he perceived that commencing with extravagant bead
53284
roll of the Heavenly powers with which they two had fortified
53347
themselves, and with impudent encomiums of their own matchless
53415
courage and endurance among men, Magloire proceeded to eulogise the
53480
nine princes of the lower world in terms the most complimentary,
53546
exhorting them to satisfy their good friends the exorcists in the
53615
mere trifle they demanded.  As this modest request was not responded
53683
to, the reciter gradually changed his tone.  The compliments became
53751
thinned by degrees and beautifully less, and were fairly well mixed
53820
with horrible threats, and approbrious epithets, which again meeting
53890
with no recognition, the theme of the chant now ceased to contain any
53960
allusion whatever of a gratifying character.  All was menace piled on
54029
menace and insult piled on insult, Pelion upon Ossa till the riotous
54094
whirl of words merged into one continuous curse, in the midst of
54162
which reverberated again and again (amid the shudders of the waters
54232
and the trembling of the earth) that ineffable sacred and secret Name
54295
of Names, at which the celestials and the terrestrials and the
54364
infernals do shake together and are troubled and confused.  And with
54430
that there rumbled thunders round the skirts of earth and belched
54498
forth lightnings from their midst.  And the lightnings continued to
54567
lighten without pause, until they seemed all one meteor of fire that
54632
hovered over the surface of the Bottomless Lake.  And the meteor
54698
burst and shot forth myriads upon myriads of shapeless forms down
54766
towards the surface, whilst upwards from the surface rose a sort of
54835
scum or mist.  And this scum or mist, meeting those shapeless forms,
54902
they seemed to seize upon it--and work it--and make it build as it
54964
were walls.  But all was seen as through a glass darkly, and,
55031
besides, the bravo was still employed in casting priceless balsams
55101
upon hissing flames that many a time and oft became half extinguished
55170
(to his terror) by the sweat that rained from his brow.  By his side
55237
the French enchanter still swayed his arms towards on high, and on
55305
high unceasingly rolled his incomprehensible cabala.  The slightest
55373
fear or the slightest hesitation, and what might not be their fate?
55441
For such a slip innumerable infernal skirmishers were hovering hard
55510
by in readiness.  But now the danger is almost over.  The gangs have
55578
done their grudging work, and a palace hangs between wind and water
55647
seductive and serene where nothing hung before.  The last odours are
55711
burning.  The weird wailing of the magus is slackening into the
55776
majestic formulæ of dismissal.  Without this termination to the
55845
ritual the magicians on leaving their sanctuary would have been torn
55907
limb from limb by the awaiting fiends.  But being expelled as
55976
ceremoniously as they had been evoked, the filmy hosts had no choice
56041
for it but to crumble into the nothingness from which they came.
56042

56110
"Go in peace unto your place!  Peace be between you and us!  Be you
56146
ready to come when you are called."
56147

56211
These culminating words of the oration were uttered at the very
56279
moment that the faithful distant watchman proclaimed it the hour of
56346
one.  As the two daring trespassers upon realms forbid stepped out
56415
from their double breast-work, the bravo in vain endeavoured to make
56482
out the exact architectural details of his palace in the darkness.
56552
It was pretty clear to him, however, that instructions given had been
56618
faithfully fulfilled.  He considered that he had done a very good
56687
night's work.  How unexpected when he left Vergilia's house was this
56755
chance rencounter that fate had in store for him.  He began to have
56823
some regard for Providence.  He paid no attention to the wizard who
56891
was commencing to obliterate his signs.  Magloire had done his work
56959
well, but he had been paid for it in advance.  So much for Monsieur
57028
Magloire (of France), who, he presumed, would now be off again about
57097
his own affairs.  Tosca strolled towards the city.  His business was
57164
to wait upon his betrothed (for such she now surely was), and drag
57226
her off at once to the castle of her behest.  A day of luxury
57295
followed by a night of love.  That was his bill of fare.  But he had
